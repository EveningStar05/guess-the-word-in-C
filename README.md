# Gues the word in C

## Overview
This is a simple guess the word game in created in C from scratch. 
I wanted to create a simple program in C just to implement what I have learned so far from CS50's Introduction to Computer Science.

## Run the Program
to run the program all you need to do is to clone this repository to your local directory.

`git clone <paste the url here>`

then on the terminal run `./guess_the_word`

## How it works
After running `./guess_the_word` on your terminal, you are given a hashed word and a prompt to guess the hashed word.
You can only guess 3 times, at the second attempt you are given a hint (only once).
So becareful and good luck! :)
